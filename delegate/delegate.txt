1) Notice that the Delegation Contract's fallback method calls the pwn() method on the delegate contract using what is sent with msg.data
   The pwn() function changes the owner of the contract, but since the storage slots line up and the method is called using delegatecall, the owner
   of the delegation contract will be changed
2) Calculate the function method id for pwn using the DoMath Contract or any other method. - bytes4(sha3("functionName(inputType)")
3) Then call the fallback method on delegation with the method id for the data - 
await sendTransaction({from:"0xD26D6EA83bd7F54006e80d5f2134d20eC5aF85c4", to:"0xd15616d338F8e9766bF2B70F71fAC3376Fec94B2", data: "0xdd365b8b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"})
