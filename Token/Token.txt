1) In the transfer function the require statement require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0); will never be less than zero since the values are uints
2) Make a contract which will call the transfer function with an extremely large value for the _value. It will pass the require
   since the uint will wrap around to a large positive number instead of going negative.
