1) Notice that the reentrance contract's withdraw funciton does msg.sender.call before changing the value of balance
2) Have your recieve function also call the withdraw method. This will create an infinite loop where the function will keep sending you funds
   which will call our contract's recieve function, which will then call the withdrawl function again all before the balance is changed
